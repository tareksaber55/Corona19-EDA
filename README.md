# COVID-19 EDA Project – South Korea 🇰🇷

This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea using demographic, geographic, and weather-related data.

## 📂 Datasets
- Confirmed cases by **age**, **sex**, and **province**
- Weather data: average/min/max temperature, wind speed, humidity
- Daily time-series of confirmed infections

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Analysis Overview
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  - Converted columns to numeric types
  - Handled missing values with `.mean()` and `.median()`
  - Filtered dataset for analysis starting from 2020

- **EDA & Visualization**
  - Plotted infection trends by date and demographic
  - Analyzed and visualized weather impact by region
  - Identified skewness in numerical columns
  - Sorted and visualized provinces by temperature, humidity, wind speed

- **Key Insights**
  - Age groups 20–29 and 50–59 had higher infection counts
  - Some regions experienced more cases despite similar weather patterns
  - Mild negative skewness observed in temperature distribution

## 📊 Example Visuals
- Line plots of case progression over time
- Bar plots comparing provinces by average temperature
- Heatmap of infection density by region and age group
